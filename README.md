Matlab code (tested on versions 2019b and 2020b) implementing the reanalyzes of the behavioral & neural [data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/wp9h39kbtv/2) originally published in [Toso et al. 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2021.08.020).

### toso2021_main.m  
- Loads the data;
- Selects which task variant to analyze (delayed duration or intensity comparison);
- Sets _if_ and _where_ to save figures;
- Sets which experimental variable to use as contrast;
- Runs all other scripts in sequence (in the same order as they appear below);
